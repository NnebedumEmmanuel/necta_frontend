// REMOVED: root-level serverless entry
// This file has been neutralized per repository maintenance: the project uses Next.js App Router
// (app/api/**/route.ts). Keeping a top-level serverless handler conflicts with Next's App Router
// routing on platforms like Vercel. The original Express-based handler was removed.

// Expose nothing to avoid accidental handling. If you need to restore this file, refer to
// the project's Git history.
